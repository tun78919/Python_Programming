Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have completed making the loading screen which will play upon launching the game. The loading screen will also run when a user selects something in the menus, chooses a character, or before the start of games. I have started making the character selection screen but have not completed it as I ran into some challenges. 
#### What have you not done for your project yet?

While I completed the loading screen and menus there are still some details on both parts which I want to change. I want to add more cosmetic features to the loading screen and maybe information regarding characters. I also must add an ‘Exit,’ button at the bottom of the menus which allows players to quit out the game when selected. I still need to complete the character selection screen and begin the process of writing the actual fighting involving player(s). I have a lot of work to do.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I had some problems with some of the cosmetic features when creating the menus. I also couldn’t get the loading screen to fully present itself when first loading the game and whenever I wanted it to be shown. Comprising the character selection screen has also been difficult but mostly time consuming. I fixed the issues I had with the loading screen but am still working on cosmetic details and character selection screen.
